# Bandgap_Reference_BGR
It's a project on Classical OpAmp based &amp; Self-biased Bandgap References. We generated reference voltage of ~1.1V using both architectures. The power consumptions of OpAmp based circuit is ~72uA and Self-biased circuit is ~26.6uA. OpAmp based circuit maintains constant ref voltage for load current deviation of ~2.6uA when temp changes by ~160â—¦C.
